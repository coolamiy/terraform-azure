+ config file have defined the log file to /var/log/redis-server.log while the log file was defined at /var/log/redis/redis-server.log and hence permission issues.
+ updated configuration file using ```sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf``` to the log file as 
```commandline

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile /var/log/redis/redis-server.log

```
+ service restarted and validated
```commandline
stylelabs@amit-lnx:/var/log$ sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
stylelabs@amit-lnx:/var/log$ sudo service redis-server start 
stylelabs@amit-lnx:/var/log$ sudo service redis-server status

Windows troubleshooting
=======================
+ Issue : hitting localhost gives 503.
+ navigated to event center-> IIS and saw default application pool as stopped.
+ tried restaring default application pool but it stopped again.
+ go to default application pool advanced settings and update Identity to ** ApllicationPoolIdentity**.
+ Restart default application pool.
+ Service started and localhost shows default IIS page.
